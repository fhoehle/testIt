\section{HO SiPM Upgrade}\label{HoSipmUpgrade}
\subsection{Hardware Design}\label{kuenskenHardwareDesign}
In the first long shutdown of the LHC, HO was subject to upgrades. The previously used HPDs\footnote{{\bf H}ybrid {\bf P}hoto-{\bf D}iodes} were replaced by SiPMs\footnote{{\bf Si}licon {\bf P}hoto-{\bf M}ultipliers} due to bad performance. The SiPM readout was designed as a drop-in replacement to keep most of the readout chain. The SiPMs were arranged on a newly produced PCB\footnote{{\bf P}rinted {\bf C}ircuit {\bf B}oard} to match the position of the pixels of the HPDs. The arrangement of the SiPMs is shown in Fig. \ref{kuenskensipmPcb}.

\label{kuenskenpeltier}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
It can be seen that the new PCB has 18 SiPMs in the position where the 18 pixels of the HPDs were.
The installed SiPM type was produced by Hamamatsu and is identical to a Hamamatsu S10931-050. It has an area of (3x3)\,mm$^2$ and comes with an SMD type housing. The cell pitch is 50\,$\mu$m.
Because HO has two layers of scintillator in ring 0 the number of fibers arriving at a single SiPM is larger in ring 0. As a consequence, the fibers cannot be arranged such that they completely fit inside the area of an SiPM. Therefore, a light mixer is installed between the ends of the fibers and the SiPM surface in ring 0. This light mixer
ensures that the light is distributed uniformly over the SiPM's surface, thus, avoiding the loss of light of only certain fibers.\\
%distributes the light of the fibers uniformly over an SiPM's surface and compensates for light losses at the edges of an SiPM.
With SiPMs being solid state devices and thus being rather sensitive to temperature changes, it is inevitable to provide a controlled temperature environment for a stable operation of the devices. A key feature is the change of the SiPM's breakdown voltage with temperature. The manufacturer specifies this quantity to be 56\,$\frac{\text{mV}}{\text{K}}$. For this reason the PCBs carrying the SiPMs are equipped with Peltier elements on their backsides. Fig. \ref{kuenskenpeltier} shows a mounted Peltier element on a PCB.
\subsection{System Performance}
\subsubsection{Temperature}
The features of an SiPM may change strongly with the temperature if not corrected for. For this reason it is important to control the temperature of an SiPM before studying other parameters to be sure that any observed change is not due to a change in the temperature. Figure \ref{kuenskentemperatureStability} shows temperature deviations from a reference temperature plotted vs. time.

\label{kuenskendarkNoise}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
Each data point represents the temperature on a PCB at a given time. It is evident that the deviations stay within a range of 0.1\,$^\circ$C which corresponds to a change of 5.6\,mV in the bias voltage

\subsubsection{Gain}
The gain determines the signal height that is produced by an SiPM and thus the measured charge in data taking. Hence, it is necessary to know the gain of an SiPM to be able to tell the number of photons that triggered the SiPM and get a measure of the deposited energy in the detector. HO uses two ways of determining the gain.
The first is to use the dark noise spectrum of an SiPM that develops due to thermal excitation of electrons in the active volume of an SiPM cell and the subsequent breakdown of that cell. A gauss fit is performed to the pedestal peak and the peaks of one and two avalanches and from the distance of the peak positions the gain is calculated. This method is known as the PED method. An example dark noise spectrum together with an applied fit is shown in Fig. \ref{kuenskendarkNoise}.
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.475\textwidth}

\label{kuenskengainHist}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
The second method uses short light pulses from an LED that are led onto the SiPMs. When the light pulses contain not too many photons, the resulting signal distribution has a mean of
\begin{equation}
\text{m}=\text{N}\times \text{gain}
\end{equation}
and a width of
\begin{equation}
\sigma=\sqrt{\text{N}}\times \text{gain}
\end{equation}
assuming Poisson statistics for the uncertainty of the number of photons. Dividing the square of the measured width of the distribution by the measured mean, one obtains the gain of an SiPM as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma^2}{\text{m}}=\frac{\text{N}\times \text{gain}^2}{\text{N}\times \text{gain}}=\text{gain.}
\end{equation}
This is called the LED method.
Before reviewing the comparability of the different methods it is necessesary to assure that the means of gain determination are stable in themselves. The relative gain variation against time using the dark nosie spectrum is depicted in Fig. \ref{kuenskengainVsTime}. It can be found that for a single PCB the relative gain variation stays within a 2\,\% frame. A histogram showing the relative gain variations for the same period for all installed SiPMs is plotted in Fig. \ref{kuenskengainHist}. The largest variations can be found to be within 3\,\%. The correlation between the two ways of determining the gain is printed in Fig. \ref{kuenskengainCorr}.
\begin{figure}[b]

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.475\textwidth}

\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.5cm}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.475\textwidth}

\label{kuenskengainCorr}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
The plot shows that the measured gain values are centered around a specific value and no large deviation are found. However, it can be noticed that the mean gain value for the LED method is systematically shifted with respect to the results from the dark noise spectrum. This shift can be explained by the fact that the spectrum measured with the LED method is not exactly gaussian. This results in a shift towards higher gain values for this method. Once this offset has been characterized it would be possible to correct for it.

\subsubsection{Breakdown Voltage}
The gain of an SiPM depends on the voltage difference between the applied voltage and the breakdown voltage of the device. It is therefore necessary to have reliable means of determining the breakdown voltage of an SiPM in order to keep the gain stable. In HO there are two ways of measuring the breakdown voltage. The first one exploits again the dark noise spectrum of an SiPM. By measuring the gain using the dark noise spectrum for different bias voltages one may plot the gain versus the bias voltage. It is then possible to fit a straight line to the distribution and extrapolate to a gain of zero pointing to the breakdown voltage. This is referred to as the PED method. The second way of breakdown voltage determination uses an LED again. The collected charge is measured for different bias voltages and then the relative derivative $\frac{\text{dS}}{\text{SdV}}$ is calculated. The resulting distribution has a maximum where the measured signal changes most with the bias voltage which is taken as the bias voltage. This method is referred to as the LED method.

\end{figure}
The variation of the breakdown voltage for a set of SiPMs on a single mounting board versus time is presented in Fig. \ref{kuenskenbvVsTime}. The employed method for the determination of the breakdown voltage is the PED method. The plot shows that the variation of the breakdown voltage stays well within 50\,mV. The correlation between the two methods is shown in Fig. \ref{kuenskenbvCorr}. The data points align along a straight line which demonstrates a well defined linear relation between the values of the two methods. The spread of the breakdown voltages is due to the fact that not all devices have the same breakdown voltage. However, it can be noted that there is an offset between the two methods which shows itself in the y-intercept. This stems from the slightly different criteria for the determination of the breakdown voltage. Once the offset is determined the breakdown voltages can be corrected for that.
