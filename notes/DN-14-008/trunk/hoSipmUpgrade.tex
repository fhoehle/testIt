\section{HO SiPM Upgrade}
\begin{itemize}
\item(Was there an introduction to HO already? If no, this goes here...)
\end{itemize}
In the first long shutdown of the LHC, the Outer Hadron Calorimeter (HO) was also subject to upgrades. The previously used HPDs\footnote{{\bf H}ybrid {\bf P}hoto{\bf d}iodes} were replaced by...
\subsection{The New Readout System}
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed to match old readout chain.
\item Two Layers in ring 0 -$>$ Light mixer for geometry reasons
\item PCB with Peltier for stabilization
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The SiPM Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item The SiPM model like s10931 (?)
\item Rather short, only the specs of the device
\end{itemize}
\subsection{System Performance}
\subsubsection{Temperature}
\begin{itemize}
\item Stability of mounting board temperature
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Breakdown Voltage}
\begin{itemize}
\item Stability of breakdown voltage 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Gain}
\begin{itemize}
\item Stability of gain
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Efficiency and Purity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maybe Yusufs plot?
\end{itemize}
