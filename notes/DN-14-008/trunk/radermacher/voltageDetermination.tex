\section{Determination of bias voltage for new MTT-Prototyps}
In order to get same signals independtly from our prototyps, a determination for the bias voltage is done by commiting the same gain for every SiPM. This should assure that QDC- and Peakheightspectra look the same. After verify the temperature regression coefficient the signal spectra is only depending of the gain given by the supplied bias voltage.
To determinate the needed bias voltage a simple teststand is built up with an oscilloscope. The read out signal trace of $500\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ are  derived and afterwards
