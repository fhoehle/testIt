\section{Studies with the Hadron Outer Calorimeter}
In the barrel region of the CMS experiment the hadronic calorimeter has a outer component placed just behind the solenoid and before the first muon stations (BILD). 
This subdetector is called the hadron outer (HO) calorimeter and is a tail catcher for jets leaking out of the inner hadronic calorimeter.
In this section the HO system and its readout structure are introduced.
