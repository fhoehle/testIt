\section{The Hadron Outer Calorimeter}\label{sec:HOintro}
The Outer Hadronic Calorimeter (HO) is a detector system designed for measuring energies of jets that leak through the solenoid. 
It consists of scintillator tiles equipped with wavelength shifting fibers.
The fibers are put in grooves in a sigma-like shape, as shown in Fig.\ \ref{kuenskenScintWithFiber}.

From the wavelength shifting fibers the light is coupled into clear fibers to guide the light towards the photo-sensors. The tile's geometry is designed to match the towers of the HCAL in the barrel region which gives a tile size of 0.087$\times$0.087 in eta and phi. The scintillators are placed behind the solenoid in front of the first layer of the iron return yoke. While the rings $\pm$1 and $\pm$2 have only one layer of scintillator, ring 0 has a second layer of scintillator behind the iron yoke. This leads to specialties when bringing the light guiding fibers onto the photo-detectors, as is described in \ref{kuenskenHardwareDesign}.\\
With the upgrade of the photon sensors to SiPMs it is now subject to studies in how far HO has capabilities of detecting muons as Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIP) and providing a discrimination
between MIP signals and leaking jets. The muon identification capability may be a key feature when thinking of providing an additional muon tag to the muon trigger system with the help of HO. A more
thorough description of HO can be found in \cite{hoDesign} and \cite{hcalTDR}, information on the SiPM upgrade is available in \cite{beniCalor}.
